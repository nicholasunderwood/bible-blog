						God promises Noah not to genocide every living creature. In exchange, Noah promises not to commit murder,
						or eat meat with blood. This, like the rest of genesis, seems oddly specific, and I think this can be interpreted
						as God deciding to interfere less in the lives of his creation. Interestingly, when God says "I set my bow in the
						clouds" he is referencing a rainbow. The rainbow signals that the rain is not a flood set to destroy all life.

						The Author is such an import component of any literary analysis. An Author's personal 
						experience and motivation for writing says a lot about the contents of the book. We have 
						limited knowledge of the authors of the bible, especially for the old testament. I am 
						interested in how we are going to bridge that gap, and what assumptions we will have to 
						make about their personal motivations for writing the most widespread book of all time. 
						For Genesis, why is their so much specific information. The book details the lifespans of 
						Adam and Eve's descendants, and the dimension's of Noah's boat. Why did the author include 
						this information, and why is the magnitude of these measurements do disproportional.

						In Genesis 11, we get the story of how a collective humanity tried to build a city that could challenge God. 
						Because all humans spoke the same language, they were able to come together and build a tower The made bricks 
						and mortar and made a city. God responds not by congratulating them but by dispersing them and establishing different

					<h2>Week One Obervations</h2>
					<p>Sep 20th 2020</p>
				</header>
				<div class="card-body">
					<p>
						Genesis is flush with references to hierarchies and dichotomies. Oddly, these are not presented in a contrictory fashion.
						The beginning of the bible starts with God observing that light is good, and dark is evil.
						Traditional literature thrives on the moral ambiguity derived from these dichotomies, but Genesis leaves no interpretation to the reader.
						The bible tells us that good is superior to evil, that light is superior to dark, and that man is superior to his compionion, women.
						This duality is also present in the brothers Abel and Cain. Again, God denotes Abel as unarguably superior to Cain, when he rewards Abel over his brother.
						<br><br>
						Interestingly, the only semblance of moral subjectivity stems from God himself (itself?). Humans are described as inherently evil.
						Eve, Adam, and Cain all receive eternal punishments for their sins. God gives no room to grow, learn, and repent.
						Genesis 6:5 reads “The LORD saw that the wickedness of humankind was great in the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of their hearts was only evil continually.”
						Again, humans, at least according to God, or inhereintly and incurably evil, to the extent that extermination - or genocide - was justified.
						<br><br>
						God, however, does not abide to the same standard. Over the course of Geonosis, we see him learn and grow. During the seven days of creation, he discerns what is good and what is evil.
						In his covenant with Noah, he promises never again to destroy all living things, which implies some degree of regret. If God believed that the floods was justified, he would have reserved the right to use them again.
						The rainbow (the bow God places in the sky) also implies that God is imperfect. If he, and his promise, were truly infallible, the reminder would not be necessary.

					<h2>Numbers in the Bible</h2>
					<p>Sep 21th 2020</p>
				</header>
				<div class="card-body">
					<p>
						In Genesis 17:1, The lord appears to Abram when he is 99 years old, which caught my eye, and I wondered if it had some significance in the bible as well.
						99 only has significance in our base 10 counting system, as it is one less than 100.
						The ancient Jews would not have had the same numerical system. In fact, our Arabic Numerals were conceived around 700 years after scholars think genesis was written, at around 600 BCE.
						But how did they record numbers? There are certainly a lot of them in the bible.
						It’s possible that the descendant’s ages were added after Genesis was initially written.
						The Hebrew counting system combines the Hebrew alphabet with Greek Numerals, but this was not adopted until about 200 CE.
						This coincides with the first substantial written records of the Jews. We accept some degree of historical truth in the Israelite’s exodus from Egypt, ancient Jews adopting the Egyptian counting system would sense.
						The Egyptians did use a base 10 system, but the complex figures would be hard to duplicate without the same supply of ink and papyrus that the Egyptians had.
						On the other side of the Saharan Desert, the Kingdom of Mesopotamia used a base 60 counting system.
						The time period matches with the creation of Genesis, but at that time, the Kingdom was relatively isolated from the Mediterranean by distance and desert.
						Based on the limited research I’ve done, I think it is more likely that the ages were added after the original creation of the Bible, but I’d be interested in looking into this more.

					<h2>Biblical Allusions in Watership Down</h2>
					<p>Sept 27th 2020</p>
				</header>
				<div class="card-body">
					<p>
						Richard Adams’ Watership Down, is a fictional story about a group of rabbits that flee their burrow and search for a safe and stable home out in the wild.
						Over the course of the book, we see the rabbits develop as individuals and as a collective group, as they overcome existential and internal threats to their lives and cohesion.
						Adams also provides the reader with an extensive culture, which differs significantly from a human way of life.
						The protagonists have a language, social hierarchy, and religion which differs slightly across the various burrows the rabbits stumble across.
						In the book’s first act, we learn about the rabbit’s creation story, which strongly parallels the first few chapters of Genesis in the Old Testament.
						<br><br>
						In an attempt to calm his group of refugees, Hazel, the group's leader, asks Dandelion to tell a story.
						Dandelion begins at the creation of the Universe, when Frith made the stars by scattering his droppings across the sky.
						Frith then added trees, plants, rivers, birds, and animals.
						Initially, the animals lived in harmony, as there were plenty of resources to go around.Frith has created the Garden of Eden.
						Enter El-ahrairah, one of, if not the first rabbits.
						El-ahrairah had so many children that they began to eat all the grass, and the rabbits moved outward, devouring and multiplying as they went.
						Frith plants his forbidden apple tree when he warns El-ahrairah that this is unacceptable, and he must control his offspring.
						El-ahrairah then bites into the forbidden fruit by telling Frith to stuff it.
						“My people are the strongest in the world, for they breed faster and eat more than any other people.”
						Frith punishes El-ahrairah by giving him predators.
						The fox, the stoat, and the weasel, all of whom had lived in harmony with El-ahrairah and his children, received sharp teeth, cunning, and a desire to hunt and kill rabbits.
						Just as women must suffer through childbirth, and men must work the dust, all rabbits live in fear of their thousand enemies, who now have the means and the desire to hunt and kill them.
						And the Tower of Babel crumbles to the ground under the holy wrath of the one true God.
						<br><br>
						Beyond the obvious parallels to God's creation of mankind, Richard Adam includes some much deeper biblical allusions.
						In Genesis, we learn that the forbidden apple grants mankind the true power of God: the ability to differentiate between good and evil.
						For rabbits, this metric is replaced with their ability to outrun, outlast, and outmaneuver their prospective predators.
						Just as God reciprocates human’s moral insight with their curses, Frith, in turn, grants El-ahrairah with cunning, intellect, and two powerful hind legs, so he can sprint from, dig from, and deceive, and listen for his enemies.
						And just as God is objectively superior to humans primarily through his infallible moral compass, Frith rules over all rabbits by his superior intellect and cunning.
						As Dandelion tells it, “Then El-ahrairah knew Frith was too clever for him, and he was frightened.”
						While the metrics by which the two tales determine their internal hierarchies are radically different, their implementations and consequences are very similar.
						<br><br>
						The context and origins of these two stories also share parallels.
						Hazel and his group are experiencing their own exodus.
						The story functions not only as a narrative to distract from the implications of their refugee status, but also to reassure them that they, as rabbits, have a place in this world.
						Their predators hunt for a reason.
						The forest is not simply an unfamiliar and perileless death trap, but a test of their speed, strength, and cunning.
						A test of how good of a rabbit they are.
						When the world revolves around even a shred of order and intention, change and calamity are much easier to process.
						It was true for the Israelites when they fled Israel.
						It was true for Fiver and Pipkin when they were lost in the woods.
						And it is true for billions of people today who find comfort, solace, and meaning from hundreds of religions across the globe.

					<h2>Week Two Obervations</h2>
					<p>Sept 28th 2020</p>
				</header>
				<div class="card-body">
					<p>
						In Genesis 12 - 20, we get a much bigger picture of the outside world.
						Instead of God interacting with his descendants in a closed system, we see the addition of nations, power structures, nations, civilizations, and people.
						This is extremely important for the bible in its context as a set of moral guidelines.
						In Genesis 12, Abram lies to the Egyptians that his wife Sarai, is his sister.
						He does this to because he fears an Egyptian will murder him so he can take Sarai as their own wife.
						The Pharaoh takes Sarai as his wife, and for his trouble, Abram gains lots to his material wealth.
						God punished the Pharaoh for his adultery, who then departed Abram and Sarai from his land.
						<br>
						In this story, Abram appears to commit sin without punishment.
						First, he fears the Egyptians will kill him for his wife, which could be considered a sin in and of itself.
						He has never been to Egypt, and has no reason to believe they would be inclined to murder him.
						His assumptions were based on nothing but a preconceived notion of how foreigners will react. Then, based on this unfounded assumption, he lies to the Egyptians, and allows his wife to marry the Pharaoh.
						Instead of being punished for this, God punishes the Pharaoh, despite the fact that he had no way of knowing he was committing adultery.
						The Pharaoh infers from his punishment that Sarai is married, and deports Sarai and Abram. He, contrary to Abrams expectations, does not kill Abram, even after being tricked into and punished for committing adultery.
						In the end, Abram gets to keep his livestock, and the Pharaoh ends up with plagues.
						<br>
						We see the same thing happen with Abram and Lot.
						Because of Abram's materialism, Lot gets captured, and Abram needs to rescue him. Abram ends up rescuing Lot, in addition to the goods, the women, and the people (who are apparently a different entity then the women).
						Abram receives no punishment, and ends up liberating more than he lost in the first place.
						It's also important to note the goods are listed before Lot, signalling their importance.
						Lot’s goods are also mentioned separately, which implies that the goods Abram had rescued were to be added to his own material wealth.
						Abrams' punishment for being selfish and materialistic is the expansion of his net worth. 
						<br>
						Again and again, Abram sins not only are not punished, but are rewarded.
						Abram is never punished for his sins, but instead is blessed with an everlasting and powerful lineage.
						God grants him a child and a new name.
						He lives happily with his family for more than twice the human lifespan, and is only almost manipulated into murdering his son once.

					<h2>Genesis 38</h2>

				<div class="card-body">
					<p>
						I think it's interesting that Genesis 38 starts with "But Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the site of the LORD, and the LORD put him to death."
						In the span of the 5 previous sentences, Judah moves, marries, has 3 children, and finds a wife for his first kid.
						Then, all of a sudden, God kills Er, who is presumably still a teenager. This is extremely contrary to the New Testament, which heavily focuses on repentance.
						Also, the phrase "Wicked in the site of the LORD" sticks out. The old testament is chalk full of moral absolutes, and the phrase seems to qualify the adjective wicked, as to say just because God sees someone as wicked, doesn't mean they are objectively wicked.

					<h2>Joseph and his Brothers</h2>

				<div class="card-body">
					<p>
						Unlike Moses or King Solomon, Joseph is not portrayed with human flaws.
						That is not to say his decisions are perfect. Even taking into account biblical standards for morality,
						Joseph’s attempt at revenge when he meets his brothers in Egypt is incorrect, and is later corrected after he listens to his brother.
						However, this anger is portrayed as righteous and justified, similar to God’s arbitrary punishments.
						In comparison, his arrogance in telling his family that they would bow down to him is irrelevant.
						Every step along his journey, Joseph is blessed by God, but continues to befall misfortune, that he later takes advantage of.
						His brothers conspire to kill him, but Reuban saves him, and they sell him into slavery instead (how merciful).
						He gains power and respect from his master, not even due to his own actions, but because he is blessed by God, and his master recognizes this.
						He is accused of rape and is thrown into jail, but even in prison, he gains favor from the jailor and rises to the top of that heirarchy.
						Because of his newfound power in divination, he gains an appointment to the rule over the entirety of Egypt.
						This entire story, we see Joseph, who is functionally no more than a vessel for God divine power, rise to the top of hierarchies faster than Andrew Carnigie.

					<h2>Joseph and his Brothers Correction</h2>
					<p>Oct 4th 2020</p>
				</header>
				<div class="card-body">
					<p>
						In my original analysis, I described how Joseph has been a flat and morally objective character.
						In reality, this couldn’t have been further from the truth.
						While Joseph does enter into our story blessed by God, he evolves has a character and as a person in so many other facets.
						Genesis 37 introduces us to a Joseph who is preferred by both his father and God, which makes him arrogant and naive.
						He tells his brothers and his family about his dreams, where they, along with the entirety of the cosmos, bow down to him.
						His father prefers him over his brothers to the extent that he makes Joseph a robe with sleeves.
						The garment itself has little significance.
						It represents his position at the top of the family hierarchy, second to only his father.
						His brothers, out of jealousy, conspire to kill him, but settle on selling him into slavery.
						We see Joseph earn power and autonomy through his favor with his master, only to be thrown into jail.
						Again, Joseph finds favor with the jail keeper, who gives him power and management responsibilities in the jail.
						<br><br>
						This puts him into a position to interpret the dreams of two of the Pharaoh's servants, and Joseph's devine networking eventually secures him a position of power second to only the Pharaoh.
						The narrative so far forms a clear pattern.
						Joseph rises to the top of a hierarchy due to his favor with God, and because of the sins of others, he falls to an even lower position, only to rise to the top again.
						The famine represents a change in this pattern, as the next component in our sequence of events, we would expect Joseph to, somehow, lose his power. Instead, it functions as a bridge back to our introduction. Joseph’s family finds themselves in need of food, and, like many others, turn to Egypt and to Joseph.
						With a level of irony to rival a greek play, Joseph’s brothers, through their own jealousy, end up bowing to their elder.
						Their show of submission represents the perfect opportunity for Joseph to show mercy and kindness by forgiving his brothers.
						Instead he acts on anger and revenge, by accusing them as spies and sending them to jail.
						When he returns, he decides to let all but one of them leave with food for their family.
						Only after learning that Reuben tried to protect him does he return his sibling’s gold and sends them - minus Simeon - on their way.
