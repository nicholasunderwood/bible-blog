					<h2>God's Covenant with Noah</h2>
					<p>Sep 16th 2020</p>
				</header>
				<div class="card-body">
					<p>
						God promises Noah not to genocide every living creature. In exchange, Noah promises not to commit murder,
						or eat meat with blood. This, like the rest of genesis, seems oddly specific, and I think this can be interpreted
						as God deciding to interfere less in the lives of his creation. Interestingly, when God says "I set my bow in the
						clouds" he is referencing a rainbow. The rainbow signals that the rain is not a flood set to destroy all life.

					<h2>Gabel</h2>

				<div class="card-body">
					<p>
						The Author is such an import component of any literary analysis. An Author's personal 
						experience and motivation for writing says a lot about the contents of the book. We have 
						limited knowledge of the authors of the bible, especially for the old testament. I am 
						interested in how we are going to bridge that gap, and what assumptions we will have to 
						make about their personal motivations for writing the most widespread book of all time. 
						For Genesis, why is their so much specific information. The book details the lifespans of 
						Adam and Eve's descendants, and the dimension's of Noah's boat. Why did the author include 
						this information, and why is the magnitude of these measurements do disproportional.

					<h2>The Tower of Babel</h2>
					<p>Sep 17th 2020</p>
				</header>
				<div class="card-body">
					<p>
						In Genesis 11, we get the story of how a collective humanity tried to build a city that could challenge God. 
						Because all humans spoke the same language, they were able to come together and build a tower The made bricks 
						and mortar and made a city. God responds not by congratulating them but by dispersing them and establishing different 
						languages. For me, this is a commentary of the power of a United Humanity. If everyone works together, we can reach the 
						heavens and challenge God. The divisions created by different cultures and languages prevents this from happening, but they 
						are not insurmountable.

					<h2>Week 1 Obervations</h2>

				<div class="card-body">
					<p>
						Genesis is flush with references to hierarchies and dichotomies. Oddly, these are not presented in a contrictory fashion.
						The beginning of the bible starts with God observing that light is good, and dark is evil.
						Traditional literature thrives on the moral ambiguity derived from these dichotomies, but Genesis leaves no interpretation to the reader.
						The bible tells us that good is superior to evil, that light is superior to dark, and that man is superior to his compionion, women.
						This duality is also present in the brothers Abel and Cain. Again, God denotes Abel as unarguably superior to Cain, when he rewards Abel over his brother.
						<br><br>
						Interestingly, the only semblance of moral subjectivity stems from God himself (itself?). Humans are described as inherently evil.
						Eve, Adam, and Cain all receive eternal punishments for their sins. God gives no room to grow, learn, and repent.
						Genesis 6:5 reads “The LORD saw that the wickedness of humankind was great in the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of their hearts was only evil continually.”
						Again, humans, at least according to God, or inhereintly and incurably evil, to the extent that extermination - or genocide - was justified.
						<br><br>
						God, however, does not abide to the same standard. Over the course of Geonosis, we see him learn and grow. During the seven days of creation, he discerns what is good and what is evil.
						In his covenant with Noah, he promises never again to destroy all living things, which implies some degree of regret. If God believed that the floods was justified, he would have reserved the right to use them again.
						The rainbow (the bow God places in the sky) also implies that God is imperfect. If he, and his promise, were truly infallible, the reminder would not be necessary.
